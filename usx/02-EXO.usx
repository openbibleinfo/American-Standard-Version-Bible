	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob): <verse number="2" style="v"/>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, <verse number="3" style="v"/>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, <verse number="4" style="v"/>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already. <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">too many and too mighty for us</char></char></note>more and mightier than we: <verse number="10" style="v"/>come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land. <verse number="11" style="v"/>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses. <verse number="12" style="v"/>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">abhorred</char></char></note>were grieved because of the children of Israel. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor: <verse number="14" style="v"/>and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">That is, <char style="it">papyrus</char>.</char></note>bulrushes, and daubed it with <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">That is, <char style="it">bitumen</char>.</char></note>slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river&#8217;s brink. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. <verse number="6" style="v"/>And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews&#8217; children. <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then said his sister to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child&#8217;s mother. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, and he became her son.

And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known. <verse number="15" style="v"/>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v"/>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father&#8217;s flock. <verse number="17" style="v"/>And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day? <verse number="19" style="v"/>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. <verse number="22" style="v"/>And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">ger</char>.</char></note>a sojourner in a foreign land.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v"/>And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. <verse number="24" style="v"/>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. <verse number="25" style="v"/>And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge <char style="add">of them</char>.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.

And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; <verse number="8" style="v"/>and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. <verse number="10" style="v"/>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? <verse number="12" style="v"/>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</para>
