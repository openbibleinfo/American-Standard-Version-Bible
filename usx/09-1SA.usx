	<chapter number="1" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite: <verse number="2" style="v"/>and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: <verse number="5" style="v"/>but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb. <verse number="6" style="v"/>And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And <char style="add">as</char> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">seed of men</char>.</char></note>man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth. <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah. <verse number="16" style="v"/>Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto. <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more <char style="add">sad</char>.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v"/>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her; <verse number="20" style="v"/>and it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, <char style="add">saying</char>, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v"/>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. <verse number="22" style="v"/>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, <char style="add">I will not go up</char> until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever. <verse number="23" style="v"/>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him. <verse number="24" style="v"/>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">The Septuagint and Syriac have, <char style="it">a bullock three years old</char>.</char></note>three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">skin</char></char></note>bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young. <verse number="25" style="v"/>And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli. <verse number="26" style="v"/>And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah. <verse number="27" style="v"/>For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him: <verse number="28" style="v"/>therefore also I have <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">lent</char></char></note>granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v"/>But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. <verse number="19" style="v"/>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah.

	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v"/>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. <verse number="23" style="v"/>And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people. <verse number="24" style="v"/>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">which I hear Jehovah&#8217;s people do spread abroad</char></char></note>that I hear: ye make Jehovah&#8217;s people to transgress. <verse number="25" style="v"/>If one man sin against another, <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">the judge</char></char></note>God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him?

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli.

And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. <verse number="7" style="v"/>Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child. <verse number="9" style="v"/>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v"/>And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. <verse number="12" style="v"/>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. <verse number="13" style="v"/>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli&#8217;s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v"/>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision. <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I. <verse number="17" style="v"/>And he said, What is the thing that <char style="add">Jehovah</char> hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v"/>And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</para>

	<para style="nb"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.</para>
	<para style="p">Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">the battle was spread</char></char></note>they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">array</char>.</char></note>army in the field about four thousand men. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies. <verse number="4" style="v"/>So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">is enthroned</char></char></note>sitteth <char style="add">above</char> the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</para>

And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. <verse number="8" style="v"/>Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">smiting</char>.</char></note>plagues in the wilderness. <verse number="9" style="v"/>Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">array</char>.</char></note>army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli. <verse number="15" style="v"/>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see. <verse number="16" style="v"/>And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">array</char>.</char></note>army, and I fled to-day out of the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">array</char>.</char></note>army.

And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. <verse number="11" style="v"/>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people.
