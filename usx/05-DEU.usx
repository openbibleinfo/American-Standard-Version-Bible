	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Jehovah spake unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Jehovah spake unto me, saying, <verse number="3" style="v"/>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore; <verse number="5" style="v"/>contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. <verse number="6" style="v"/>Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. <verse number="7" style="v"/>For Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Jehovah thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. <verse number="8" style="v"/>So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber.</para>
