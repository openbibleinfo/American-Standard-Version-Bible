	<para style="p"><verse number="41" style="v"/>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? <verse number="42" style="v"/>While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings. <verse number="43" style="v"/>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king: <verse number="44" style="v"/>and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king&#8217;s mule; <verse number="45" style="v"/>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again.

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, <verse number="2" style="v"/>I am going the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man; <verse number="3" style="v"/>and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, <char style="add">and</char> his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">do wisely</char></char></note>prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself; <verse number="4" style="v"/>that Jehovah may establish his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel. <verse number="5" style="v"/>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">set</char>.</char></note>shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. <verse number="6" style="v"/>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace. <verse number="7" style="v"/>But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. <verse number="9" style="v"/>Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v"/>And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. <verse number="12" style="v"/>And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v"/>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. <verse number="14" style="v"/>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on. <verse number="15" style="v"/>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother&#8217;s; for it was his from Jehovah. <verse number="16" style="v"/>And now I ask one petition of thee; <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">turn not away my face</char>.</char></note>deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. <verse number="17" style="v"/>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v"/>Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king&#8217;s mother; and she sat on his right hand. <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. <verse number="22" style="v"/>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life. <verse number="24" style="v"/>Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day. <verse number="25" style="v"/>And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v"/>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">a man of</char>.</char></note>worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. <verse number="27" style="v"/>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v"/>And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <verse number="29" style="v"/>And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. <verse number="30" style="v"/>And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. <verse number="31" style="v"/>And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father&#8217;s house. <verse number="32" style="v"/>And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, <char style="add">to wit</char>, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. <verse number="33" style="v"/>So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah. <verse number="34" style="v"/>Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. <verse number="35" style="v"/>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="36" style="v"/>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. <verse number="37" style="v"/>For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. <verse number="38" style="v"/>And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="39" style="v"/>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath. <verse number="40" style="v"/>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. <verse number="41" style="v"/>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. <verse number="42" style="v"/>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest unto thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The saying that I have heard is good. <verse number="43" style="v"/>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with? <verse number="44" style="v"/>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head. <verse number="45" style="v"/>But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever. <verse number="46" style="v"/>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v"/>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. <verse number="5" style="v"/>In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. <verse number="9" style="v"/>Give thy servant therefore an <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">hearing</char>.</char></note>understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">heavy</char>.</char></note>great people?</para>
