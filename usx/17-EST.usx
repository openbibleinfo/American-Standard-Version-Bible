	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus. <verse number="10" style="v"/>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">eunuchs</char> (and so in <ref loc="EST 1:12">verse 12</ref>, etc.)</char></note>chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, <verse number="11" style="v"/>to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on. <verse number="12" style="v"/>But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king&#8217;s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v"/>Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for so was the king&#8217;s manner toward all that knew law and judgment; <verse number="14" style="v"/>and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king&#8217;s face, and sat first in the kingdom), <verse number="15" style="v"/>What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? <verse number="16" style="v"/>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. <verse number="17" style="v"/>For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">tell</char> it</char></note>say <char style="add">the like</char> unto all the king&#8217;s princes.

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then said the king&#8217;s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: <verse number="3" style="v"/>and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">Hegee</char>.</char></note>Hegai the king&#8217;s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them; <verse number="4" style="v"/>and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v"/>There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite, <verse number="6" style="v"/>who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">In <ref loc="2KI 24:6">2 Kin. 24:6</ref>, <char style="it">Jehoiachin</char>.</char></note>Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And he <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">nourished</char>.</char></note>brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle&#8217;s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>So it came to pass, when the king&#8217;s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king&#8217;s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king&#8217;s house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women. <verse number="10" style="v"/>Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women&#8217;s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, <char style="add">to wit</char>, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women), <verse number="13" style="v"/>then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: Whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king&#8217;s house. <verse number="14" style="v"/>In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king&#8217;s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name. <verse number="15" style="v"/>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king&#8217;s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v"/>So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. <verse number="17" style="v"/>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther&#8217;s feast; and he made a <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">rest</char>.</char></note>release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">hand</char>.</char></note>bounty of the king.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v"/>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king&#8217;s gate. <verse number="20" style="v"/>Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. <verse number="21" style="v"/>In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king&#8217;s gate, two of the king&#8217;s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. <verse number="22" style="v"/>And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king <char style="add">thereof</char> in Mordecai&#8217;s name. <verse number="23" style="v"/>And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</para>
	<chapter number="3" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And all the king&#8217;s servants, that were in the king&#8217;s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence. <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then the king&#8217;s servants, that were in the king&#8217;s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king&#8217;s commandment? <verse number="4" style="v"/>Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai&#8217;s <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">words</char></char></note>matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath. <verse number="6" style="v"/>But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v"/>In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, <char style="add">to</char> the twelfth <char style="add">month</char>, which is the month Adar. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">separated</char></char></note>dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from <char style="add">those of</char> every people; neither keep they the king&#8217;s laws: therefore it is not <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">meet for the king</char></char></note>for the king&#8217;s profit to suffer them. <verse number="9" style="v"/>If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the <char style="add">king&#8217;s</char> business, to bring it into the king&#8217;s treasuries. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews&#8217; enemy. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>Then were the king&#8217;s <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">secretaries</char></char></note>scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king&#8217;s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king&#8217;s ring. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And letters were sent by posts into all the king&#8217;s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth <char style="add">day</char> of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey. <verse number="14" style="v"/>A copy of the writing, <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">to be given out for a decree</char></char></note>that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day. <verse number="15" style="v"/>The posts went forth in haste by the king&#8217;s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</para>
	<chapter number="4" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; <verse number="2" style="v"/>and he came even before the king&#8217;s gate: for none might enter within the king&#8217;s gate clothed with sackcloth. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And in every province, whithersoever the king&#8217;s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">sackcloth and ashes were spread under many</char>.</char></note>many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v"/>And Esther&#8217;s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not. <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king&#8217;s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was. <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king&#8217;s gate. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king&#8217;s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. <verse number="8" style="v"/>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai, <char style="add">saying</char>: <verse number="11" style="v"/>All the king&#8217;s servants, and the people of the king&#8217;s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days. <verse number="12" style="v"/>And they told to Mordecai Esther&#8217;s words.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v"/>Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king&#8217;s house, more than all the Jews. <verse number="14" style="v"/>For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father&#8217;s house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this? <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai, <verse number="16" style="v"/>Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. <verse number="17" style="v"/>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</para>
	<chapter number="5" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king&#8217;s house, over against the king&#8217;s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v"/>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is: <verse number="8" style="v"/>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&#8217;s gate, that he stood not up nor <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">trembled before him</char></char></note>moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. <verse number="10" style="v"/>Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. <verse number="12" style="v"/>Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king. <verse number="13" style="v"/>Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&#8217;s gate. <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">tree</char>.</char></note>gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet.

Then said the king&#8217;s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king&#8217;s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the king&#8217;s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself? <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor, <verse number="8" style="v"/>let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">and the crown royal which is set upon his head</char></char></note>and on the head of which a crown royal is set: <verse number="9" style="v"/>and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king&#8217;s most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v"/>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king&#8217;s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor. <verse number="12" style="v"/>And Mordecai came again to the king&#8217;s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him. <verse number="14" style="v"/>While they were yet talking with him, came the king&#8217;s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</para>

Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine <char style="add">and went</char> into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king&#8217;s mouth, they covered Haman&#8217;s face. <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">tree</char>.</char></note>gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.
