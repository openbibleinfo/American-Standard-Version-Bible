	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in <char style="add">certain</char> of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles; <verse number="4" style="v"/>youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king&#8217;s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king&#8217;s dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king. <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave <char style="add">the name of</char> Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, <char style="add">of</char> Shadrach; and to Mishael, <char style="add">of</char> Meshach; and to Azariah, <char style="add">of</char> Abed-nego.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king&#8217;s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. <verse number="9" style="v"/>Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king. <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then said Daniel to <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">Hammelzar</char>.</char></note>the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: <verse number="12" style="v"/>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">herbs</char></char></note>pulse to eat, and water to drink. <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king&#8217;s dainties; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v"/>So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days. <verse number="15" style="v"/>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king&#8217;s dainties. <verse number="16" style="v"/>So <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">Hammelzar</char>.</char></note>the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v"/>Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And at the end of the days which the king had <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">said</char>.</char></note>appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him. <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream. <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">in Aramaic</char></char></note>in the Syrian language, <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft"><ref loc="DAN 2:4-7:28">2:4&#8211;7:28</ref> is in Aramaic.</char></note>O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation. <verse number="5" style="v"/>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">The word is gone forth from me</char></char></note>The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. <verse number="6" style="v"/>But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof. <verse number="7" style="v"/>They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation. <verse number="8" style="v"/>The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Aramaic <char style="it">buy the time</char>.</char></note>gain time, because ye see <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">the word is gone forth from me: that if etc.</char></char></note>the thing is gone from me. <verse number="9" style="v"/>But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. <verse number="10" style="v"/>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king&#8217;s matter, forasmuch as no king, <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, be he never so <char style="it">great and powerful, hath etc.</char></char></note>lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. <verse number="12" style="v"/>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. <verse number="13" style="v"/>So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v"/>Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king&#8217;s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; <verse number="15" style="v"/>he answered and said to Arioch the king&#8217;s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. <verse number="16" style="v"/>And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">give him time</char></char></note>appoint him a time, <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">that he might</char></char></note>and he would show the king the interpretation.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: <verse number="18" style="v"/>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. <verse number="20" style="v"/>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding; <verse number="22" style="v"/>he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. <verse number="23" style="v"/>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king&#8217;s matter. <verse number="24" style="v"/>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v"/>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. <verse number="26" style="v"/>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? <verse number="27" style="v"/>Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king; <verse number="28" style="v"/>but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.
